        <h3>Boost your SEO Ranking</h3>
        <div class="">
            <p>
                <b>Problem:</b> Multilanguage Articles did not get added to the sitemap. Therefore you will not rank for your translated blog content.
            </p>
             <p>
                <b>Example</b> Create a blog in your primary language and translate the blog articles into different languages. 
            </p>          
             <p>
                <b>Solution:</b> After installing the App, a new sitemap with the existing blog articles gets created based on the configuration in the scheduled actions. 
                <br/>                 
                 Go to the scheduled actions and configure the update interval. After that, activate the schedule action (Create sitemap). Finally, run the sitemap manually for the first time and check your new generated sitemap: /sitemap.xml
